# Age-and-Gender-prediction-model-based-on-text
This is a repository for a model that predicts author's age and gender based on their text. A combination of two random forest models was used, one - for age, the other - for gender.

There are two versions of the model, the first one that predicts age as a number, the second one predicts age as a cathegory (0-20, 21-30, 30+).

The model is badly predicting 30+ cathegory.

In the end there is a section for users to input a sentence and try the model out themselves.
